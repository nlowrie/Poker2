# Timer Functionality Complete Fix

## Issue Description
When users clicked the "Reset Timer" button and then clicked "Start Timer", the system was not using the configured timer interval. Additionally, there were timing inconsistencies causing time loss during pause/resume cycles.

## Root Causes
1. **Start Timer Issue**: The `startTimer` function was preserving existing `timeRemaining` values instead of using the configured timer interval
2. **Timer Logic Issue**: Using `setTimeout` instead of `setInterval` was causing timing inconsistencies
3. **Duplicate Reset Logic**: Reset functionality was implemented in two places with potential inconsistencies

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Start Timer Function
**Before (Problematic)**:
```typescript
const timeLimit = timeRemaining !== null ? timeRemaining : (customTimerMinutes * 60);
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
const startTimer = () => {
  // Always use the configured timer duration for a fresh start
  const timeLimit = customTimerMinutes * 60;
  console.log('‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting timer with configured duration:', timeLimit, 'seconds');
  
  // Always set the time remaining to the configured duration
  setTimeRemaining(timeLimit);
  setVotingTimeLimit(timeLimit);
  
  setTimerActive(true);
  // ... rest of function
};
```

### 2. Fixed Timer Effect Logic
**Changed from `setTimeout` to `setInterval`**:
- **Before**: Used `setTimeout` with recursive calls, causing potential timing drift
- **After**: Uses `setInterval` for consistent 1-second intervals
- **Benefit**: More reliable timing, no accumulated timing errors

### 3. Consolidated Reset Logic
**Before**: Reset functionality was duplicated in button handler and `resetTimer` function
**After**: Button directly calls `resetTimer` function for consistency

## Key Changes Made
1. **startTimer()**: Always uses configured interval, never preserves old countdown
2. **Timer useEffect**: Changed from `setTimeout` to `setInterval` for reliable timing
3. **Reset button**: Now calls `resetTimer()` function directly
4. **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed console logs for debugging

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Reset Timer**: Sets timer to configured interval (e.g., 5 minutes) and stops countdown
2. **Start Timer**: Always starts a fresh countdown using the configured interval
3. **Resume Timer**: Continues countdown from where it was paused (unchanged)
4. **No Time Loss**: Pause/resume cycles preserve exact timing
5. **Timer Synchronization**: All participants see the same timer state

## Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Flow**: Start (5:00) ‚Üí Pause (4:30) ‚Üí Resume (4:30) ‚Üí Reset (5:00) ‚Üí Start (5:00)
2. **Custom Interval**: Change to 3 minutes ‚Üí Reset ‚Üí Should show 3:00
3. **Multiple Cycles**: Start ‚Üí Pause ‚Üí Resume ‚Üí Pause ‚Üí Resume ‚Üí Reset ‚Üí Should return to configured time

## Files Modified
- `src/components/VotingSession.tsx`:
  - Fixed `startTimer` function logic
  - Changed timer effect from `setTimeout` to `setInterval`
  - Consolidated reset button to use `resetTimer` function

## Console Log Verification
Look for these patterns to confirm fixes:
- Start: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting timer with configured duration: X seconds`
- Reset: `üîÑ resetTimer function called` and `üîÑ Setting timer to configured duration: X seconds`
- No timing gaps between pause/resume cycles
