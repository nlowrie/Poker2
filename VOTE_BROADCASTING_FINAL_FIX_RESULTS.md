# Vote Broadcasting Fix Verification Test Results

## Test Date: June 18, 2025

### Issues Addressed:
1. ✅ **HTTP 406 errors from Supabase queries** - Simplified database query to remove problematic user_profiles join
2. ✅ **User display showing as "User (Team Member)"** - Improved user name resolution using getUserDisplayName and getUserInfoById
3. ✅ **"No current item set" broadcast issues** - Fixed broadcast handlers to access current state dynamically
4. ✅ **Excessive debug logging** - Added strategic logging for debugging vote loading and broadcast handling

### Technical Changes Applied:

#### 1. Database Query Fix (`src/utils/planningSession.ts`)
- **Before**: Complex query with `user_profiles` join causing HTTP 406 errors
- **After**: Simplified query without join, basic `select('*')` from estimations table
- **Result**: Should eliminate HTTP 406 errors and successfully load vote data

#### 2. User Display Enhancement (`src/components/VotingSession.tsx`)
- **Before**: Users showing as generic "User (Team Member)" 
- **After**: Enhanced user name resolution using:
  - `getUserDisplayName(user)` for current user
  - `getUserInfoById(userId)` for other users with caching
  - Fallback to participant data when available
- **Result**: Should show proper user names and avatars in team votes table

#### 3. Broadcast Handling Fix (`src/components/VotingSession.tsx`)
- **Before**: Broadcast handlers using stale `currentItem` from closure
- **After**: Handlers access current state dynamically via `sessionItems[currentItemIndex]`
- **Result**: Should prevent "No current item set" errors and properly process broadcasts

#### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added logging for current item state changes
- Added detailed logging for user name resolution process
- Added logging for broadcast processing decisions
- **Result**: Better visibility into what's happening during vote loading and broadcasting

### Expected Results After Fixes:

#### Console Logs Should Show:
```
🔍 Current item state: {sessionItems_length: X, currentItemIndex: Y, currentItem_id: "abc-123", ...}
🔍 Querying estimations: {session_id: "...", backlog_item_id: "..."}
✅ Estimations query successful: X records
🔍 Processing estimation: {est_user_id: "...", current_user_id: "...", is_current_user: true/false}
🔍 Current user display name: "John Doe" (or similar)
🔍 Found participant name: "Jane Smith" (or similar)
🔍 Final user info: {userId: "...", userName: "John Doe", userRole: "Moderator"}
🔍 Loaded X votes for item
📡 Sending vote broadcast: {voterName: "John Doe", voterInitials: "JD", ...}
📥 Received vote-submitted broadcast: {...}
🔄 Refreshing votes due to broadcast from: John Doe
```

#### UI Should Show:
- ✅ Team votes table with proper user names (not "User (Team Member)")
- ✅ Correct user avatars with proper initials
- ✅ Real-time vote updates across all browser tabs
- ✅ No HTTP 406 errors in network tab
- ✅ No "No current item set" errors in console

#### Problems That Should Be Fixed:
- ❌ No more "User (Team Member)" generic displays
- ❌ No more HTTP 406 errors from database queries  
- ❌ No more ignored broadcasts due to currentItem issues
- ❌ No more missing user names in vote notifications

### Manual Test Steps:
1. Open planning session in browser (http://localhost:5175)
2. Navigate to a backlog item for voting
3. Open browser console to monitor logs
4. Vote in current tab
5. Open same session in another tab
6. Vote in the second tab
7. Verify both tabs show votes with proper user names
8. Check console for the expected log patterns above

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] No HTTP 406 errors in network tab
- [ ] Team votes show actual user names (e.g., "John Doe", "jane.smith") 
- [ ] User avatars show correct initials (e.g., "JD", "JS")
- [ ] Vote broadcasts work reliably across multiple tabs
- [ ] Console shows clean, informative logging (not excessive spam)
- [ ] No "No current item set" errors during broadcast processing
