# Fix: Current User Name Display in Team Votes

## Issue
The testmod user (and other logged-in users) are showing as "Anonymous User" in the team votes table instead of displaying their actual name.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because the estimation data retrieved from the database doesn't include the complete user profile information (like `user_profiles.full_name`), so the fallback logic was reaching "Anonymous User" instead of using the available current user information.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced User Name Resolution
Added special handling for the current user's vote:

```typescript
// If this is the current user's vote and we don't have a name from the database,
// use the current user's information from auth context
if (est.user_id === user?.id && !userName) {
  userName = currentUser.name || 
            user.user_metadata?.full_name || 
            user.email?.split('@')[0] || 
            'You';
}
```

### 2. Improved User Role Detection
Enhanced role detection for the current user:

```typescript
const userRole = est.user_profiles?.role || 
                est.role || 
                (est.user_id === user?.id ? currentUser.role : 'Team Member');
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to understand what user data is available:

```typescript
// Debug: Log available user data
console.log('üîç Debug - Current user data:', {
  currentUser: currentUser,
  authUser: user,
  authUserMetadata: user?.user_metadata,
  authUserEmail: user?.email
});

// Debug: Log estimation data structure
console.log('üîç Debug - Estimation data:', {
  user_id: est.user_id,
  user_profiles: est.user_profiles,
  user_metadata: est.user_metadata,
  users: est.users,
  email: est.email,
  isCurrentUser: est.user_id === user?.id
});
```

## User Name Resolution Priority

The new resolution logic tries these sources in order:

### For Current User's Vote:
1. `est.user_profiles?.full_name` (from database join)
2. `est.user_metadata?.full_name` (from auth metadata)
3. `est.users?.email?.split('@')[0]` (from users table)
4. `est.email?.split('@')[0]` (direct email field)
5. **NEW:** `currentUser.name` (from props)
6. **NEW:** `user.user_metadata?.full_name` (from auth context)
7. **NEW:** `user.email?.split('@')[0]` (from auth context)
8. **NEW:** `'You'` (clear self-identifier)
9. `'Anonymous User'` (final fallback)

### For Other Users' Votes:
1. `est.user_profiles?.full_name`
2. `est.user_metadata?.full_name`
3. `est.users?.email?.split('@')[0]`
4. `est.email?.split('@')[0]`
5. `'Anonymous User'`

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
Team Votes:
[JD] Anonymous User (Team Member) - You
[AB] Anonymous User (Team Member)
```

### After Fix:
```
Team Votes:
[TM] testmod (Moderator) - You
[JD] john.doe (Team Member)
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Current User Display
1. Log in as testmod user
2. Vote on an item
3. Check team votes table
4. **Expected:** Should show "testmod" or email username, not "Anonymous User"

### Test Case 2: Debug Information
1. Open browser console
2. Vote on an item or refresh votes
3. Look for debug logs starting with "üîç Debug"
4. **Expected:** Should see current user data and estimation data structure

### Test Case 3: Mixed Users
1. Have multiple users vote (some with full profiles, some without)
2. Check that current user always shows correctly
3. Other users should show best available name
4. **Expected:** No "Anonymous User" for the logged-in user

## Console Output to Look For

```
üîç Debug - Current user data: {
  currentUser: { name: "testmod", role: "Moderator", ... },
  authUser: { id: "...", email: "testmod@...", ... },
  authUserMetadata: { full_name: "...", ... },
  authUserEmail: "testmod@example.com"
}

üîç Debug - Estimation data: {
  user_id: "...",
  user_profiles: null, // or user profile data
  user_metadata: null, // or metadata
  users: null, // or user data
  email: null, // or email
  isCurrentUser: true // for current user's vote
}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/VotingSession.tsx` - Enhanced user name resolution with current user priority

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix with the testmod user
2. Review console output to understand data availability
3. Remove debug logging after confirming the fix works
4. Consider improving database queries to include user profile joins
