   - **What to check**: Should list all participants with their details

2. **🎥 PARTICIPANTS TO RENDER**

3. **❌ DUPLICATE PARTICIPANTS DETECTED!**

### 🎯 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

#### ✅ SUCCESSFUL FLOW:
- All steps appear in order
- Media permissions granted
- Local video appears in your avatar
- Remote participants appear in video avatars
- Participants list shows green styling for video call users
- No duplicate participant errors

#### ❌ COMMON ISSUES:
- **No media permissions**: Check browser permissions
- **No remote participants**: Check WebRTC connection logs
- **Duplicate participants**: Look for the duplicate detection error
- **Participant list not updating**: Check presence tracking logs

### 🛠️ HOW TO TEST

1. **Open browser developer console (F12)**
2. **Start a video call** - watch for all the "STEP" logs
3. **Open a second browser tab/window** - join the same session
4. **Click "Join Video Call"** - watch for JOIN STEP logs
5. **Check both views** - both should see each other's video avatars
6. **Check participant list** - should show green styling for video call participants
