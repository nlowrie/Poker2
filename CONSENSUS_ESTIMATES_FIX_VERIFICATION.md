# Consensus Estimates Fix Verification

## Fix Applied
- **Problem**: `getSessionConsensusEstimates` function was trying to query with joins to `backlog_items` and `user_profiles` tables, but the simple `consensus_estimates` table doesn't have foreign key constraints, causing 400 errors.
- **Solution**: Removed the invalid joins from the query, now only selecting from the `consensus_estimates` table directly.

## Changes Made
1. Updated `getSessionConsensusEstimates` in `src/utils/planningSession.ts`
   - Removed joins: `backlog_items(title, description, priority), user_profiles(full_name, role)`
   - Changed select clause to simple `*`
   - Added detailed console logging for debugging

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Consensus Flow Test
1. Navigate to the Planning Dashboard
2. Join or create a planning session
3. Go to the voting interface 
4. Vote on an item and apply consensus
5. Check browser console for consensus save logs
6. Return to dashboard and verify consensus is displayed

### 2. Dashboard Display Test
1. Open Planning Dashboard
2. Look for sessions with consensus estimates
3. Check for proper visual indicators:
   - Blue checkmark for consensus
   - "Estimated" badge
   - Correct estimate values displayed

### 3. Database Verification
Check the `consensus_estimates` table in Supabase to verify:
- Records are being created correctly
- All required fields are populated
- No duplicate entries

## Expected Behavior

### Console Logs
- ‚úÖ "üîç Fetching consensus estimates for session: [session-id]"
- ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Retrieved consensus estimates: X records"
- ‚úÖ "üìä Dashboard fetched consensus estimates: X records"

### Dashboard Display
- Sessions with consensus should show blue checkmarks
- Items with consensus should display the estimate value
- "Estimated" badges should appear on consensus items
- No 400 errors in network tab

### Database State
- `consensus_estimates` table should contain records with:
  - `session_id`
  - `backlog_item_id` 
  - `estimate_value`
  - `applied_by`
  - `applied_at`

## Troubleshooting

If consensus estimates still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify the consensus was actually saved (check console logs during voting)
3. Check Supabase table directly for data
4. Ensure the session ID matches between voting and dashboard

## Success Criteria
- [ ] No 400 errors when loading dashboard
- [ ] Consensus estimates display correctly in dashboard
- [ ] Blue checkmarks and "Estimated" badges show for consensus items
- [ ] Console logs show successful data retrieval
- [ ] Database contains valid consensus records
