# Timer Reset Behavior - Implementation Summary

## Updated Timer Controls Behavior

### ✅ **Reset Button Functionality**
- **Previous Behavior**: Reset button was sometimes disabled and didn't properly reset the timer state
- **New Behavior**: 
  - Reset button is always available (never disabled)
  - When clicked, it stops any active timer
  - Sets the timer to the configured duration (from the custom timer input)
  - Timer shows the reset time but remains **stopped**
  - Moderator **must click Start** to begin the countdown

### ✅ **Timer Control Flow**
1. **Initial State**: Timer shows `--:--` (not set)
2. **After Reset**: Timer shows configured time (e.g., `5:00`) but is **stopped**
3. **After Start**: Timer begins counting down from the configured time
4. **After Pause**: Timer stops but maintains current time
5. **After Resume**: Timer continues from where it was paused

### ✅ **Button States**
- **Start Button**: Available when timer is not active
- **Pause Button**: Available when timer is actively counting down
- **Resume Button**: Available when timer is paused (stopped but has time remaining)
- **Reset Button**: Always available, sets timer to configured duration and stops it

### ✅ **Real-time Synchronization**
- All timer actions are broadcast to all session participants
- Timer state is synchronized across all users
- Team members see the same timer state as the moderator

### ✅ **Timer Input Integration**
- Custom timer duration input (1-60 minutes) is respected
- Reset button uses the current value from the timer input
- Start button uses the configured duration when no time is set

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Start
1. Open moderator panel
2. Set timer to 3 minutes
3. Click **Reset** → Timer shows `3:00` but is stopped
4. Click **Start** → Timer begins counting down from `3:00`

### Scenario 2: Mid-Session Reset
1. Timer is running (e.g., at `1:30`)
2. Click **Reset** → Timer shows `3:00` (configured time) and stops
3. Click **Start** → Timer begins counting down from `3:00`

### Scenario 3: Paused Timer Reset
1. Timer is paused (e.g., at `2:15`)
2. Click **Reset** → Timer shows `3:00` and is stopped
3. Click **Start** → Timer begins counting down from `3:00`

## Implementation Details

### Functions Modified:
- `resetTimer()`: Now properly stops timer and sets to configured duration
- `startTimer()`: Enhanced to handle both fresh starts and resumes
- Timer button logic: Improved state management and button availability

### Key Changes:
- Reset button is never disabled
- Reset always stops the timer (sets `timerActive` to false)
- Reset uses current `customTimerMinutes` value
- Start button handles both initial starts and resume scenarios
- Proper synchronization across all participants
