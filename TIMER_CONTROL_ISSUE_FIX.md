# Timer Control Issue Fix

## Problem Identified
The timer countdown was continuing regardless of pause/reset button presses. The enhanced logging showed that the button functions were being called correctly, but the timer effect wasn't respecting the `timerActive` state changes.

## Root Cause
The timer effect was missing `timeRemaining` from its dependencies array. This meant:
1. When `setTimerActive(false)` was called (pause/reset), the effect didn't re-run to clear the interval
2. When `setTimeRemaining()` was called (reset), the effect didn't re-run to handle the new time value
3. The old interval continued running even though the state said the timer was inactive

## Fix Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
}, [timerActive, currentUser.role, channel]); // Missing timeRemaining

// AFTER (FIXED) 
}, [timerActive, currentUser.role, channel, timeRemaining]); // Added timeRemaining back
```

## Enhanced Logging Added
Additional logging to track state changes:
- **Pause Timer**: Now logs when `timerActive` is set to false and mentions effect cleanup should happen
- **Reset Timer**: Now logs both the `timerActive` change and `timeRemaining` change with effect triggers

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Start Timer
```
🚀 START TIMER BUTTON CLICKED
📊 Current state before start: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: null, ...}
⚙️ Configured timer interval: 5 minutes = 300 seconds
🔄 Setting timer to configured duration...
▶️ Activating timer countdown...
✅ Timer started successfully - countdown should begin from 300 seconds
⏰ Timer effect triggered: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 300}
⏰ Setting up timer interval - time remaining: 300
⏰ Timer tick - new time: 299
```

### Pause Timer (Should Now Work)
```
⏸️ PAUSE TIMER BUTTON CLICKED
📊 Current state before pause: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 250}
⏸️ Setting timer to inactive - stopping countdown...
⏸️ Timer state changed to: false - this should trigger timer effect cleanup
✅ Timer paused successfully at 250 seconds remaining
⏰ Timer effect triggered: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: 250}
⏰ Clearing timer interval
⏰ Timer effect - no action needed: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: 250}
```

### Resume Timer (Should Continue From Pause Point)
```
▶️ RESUME TIMER BUTTON CLICKED
📊 Current state before resume: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: 250}
▶️ Reactivating timer countdown from 250 seconds...
✅ Timer resumed successfully - countdown continues from 250 seconds
⏰ Timer effect triggered: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 250}
⏰ Setting up timer interval - time remaining: 250
⏰ Timer tick - new time: 249
```

### Reset Timer (Should Stop and Reset to Configured Interval)
```
🔄 RESET TIMER BUTTON CLICKED
📊 Current state before reset: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 180, customTimerMinutes: 5}
🛑 Stopping any active countdown...
🛑 Timer state changed to: false - this should trigger timer effect cleanup
⚙️ Configured timer interval: 5 minutes = 300 seconds
🔄 Resetting timer to configured duration...
🔄 Timer state changed - timeRemaining set to: 300 - this should trigger timer effect
✅ Timer reset successfully - ready to start from 300 seconds
⏰ Timer effect triggered: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: 300}
⏰ Clearing timer interval
⏰ Timer effect - no action needed: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: 300}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Start/Pause/Resume
1. Click "Start Timer" → Should start countdown from 300 (5 minutes)
2. Let it run to ~250 seconds, click "Pause" → Should stop immediately at ~250
3. Wait a few seconds, click "Resume" → Should continue from exactly where paused
4. **Expected**: No countdown during pause, exact time preservation

### Test 2: Reset During Active Countdown
1. Click "Start Timer" → Should start countdown from 300
2. Let it run to ~200 seconds, click "Reset" → Should immediately stop and reset to 300
3. Timer should be stopped (not counting down)
4. Click "Start Timer" → Should start fresh countdown from 300

### Test 3: Reset During Pause
1. Start timer, pause at ~250 seconds
2. Click "Reset" → Should reset to 300 and remain stopped
3. Click "Start Timer" → Should start fresh countdown from 300

## Key Indicators of Success
- **Pause**: Timer immediately stops counting down, time is preserved
- **Resume**: Timer continues from exactly where it was paused
- **Reset**: Timer stops counting and resets to configured interval (300 seconds)
- **No Time Loss**: Pause/resume cycles preserve exact timing
- **Effect Cleanup**: Console shows "⏰ Clearing timer interval" when buttons are pressed
