# Video Call Participant Display Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

The main issue was that **participants in video calls were not being visually indicated in the participant list**. Here's what I fixed:

### 1. Updated Participant Data Structure
- Added `inVideoCall?: boolean` to the participant type definition
- This flag tracks whether each participant is currently in a video call

### 2. Fixed Presence Data Processing
- Updated the presence sync handler to capture the `in_video_call` flag from presence data
- Now when users join/leave video calls, their status is properly tracked

### 3. Enhanced Participant List Display
- Participants in video calls now have:
  - **Green border and background** instead of gray
  - **Green avatar background** instead of blue
  - **Camera emoji (ðŸŽ¥)** next to their name
  - **"In Video Call" label** under their role
  - **Visual distinction** from regular participants

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Video Call Display
1. Open the app and join a session
2. Start a video call by clicking "Start Video Call"
3. **Expected Result**: Your name in the participant list should now show:
   - Green border around your participant card
   - Camera emoji ðŸŽ¥ next to your name
   - "In Video Call" text under your role
   - Green avatar background

### Test 2: Multi-User Video Call Display
1. Have another user join the same session
2. They should see YOUR participant card with video call indicators
3. When they click "Join Video Call", THEIR card should also show video indicators
4. **Expected Result**: All users in the video call are clearly marked

### Test 3: Leave Video Call
1. Click "Leave Call" 
2. **Expected Result**: The video call indicators should disappear from your participant card
3. Other users should see your indicators disappear too

### Test 4: New User Joining Session with Active Video Call
1. Have a video call active
2. Have a new user join the session via invite link
3. **Expected Result**: New user should immediately see who's in the video call

## Visual Indicators to Look For

### Regular Participants:
- Gray border
- Blue avatar background
- No camera emoji
- Just shows role (e.g., "Team Member")

### Video Call Participants:
- **Green border and background**
- **Green avatar background**
- **Camera emoji ðŸŽ¥**
- **"In Video Call" text**

## If It's Still Not Working

If you don't see these visual indicators:

1. **Check browser console** for any errors
2. **Refresh the page** - sometimes presence state needs to sync
3. **Test with two browser tabs** to see real-time updates
4. **Ensure Supabase connection** is working (check network tab)

## Next Steps

If the participant display is now working correctly, the video conference system should be fully functional with:
- âœ… Integrated video UI (not modal)
- âœ… Clear participant display and status tracking
- âœ… WebRTC peer-to-peer connections
- âœ… Proper join/leave flow
- âœ… Visual indicators for who's in video calls

The main loop issue was that we were fixing technical errors but not addressing the core user experience problem - users couldn't see who was in video calls!
