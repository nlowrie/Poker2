# Voting System Functionality

## Overview
The collaborative planning poker app now has a fully functional real-time voting system that meets all the specified requirements.

## Key Features

### 1. **Vote Submission & Storage**
- ✅ Team members can select their estimate from voting cards (Fibonacci or T-Shirt sizes)
- ✅ Votes are saved to the `estimations` table in Supabase with proper relationships
- ✅ Each vote is linked to a specific backlog item and session
- ✅ Votes are persisted and survive page refreshes

### 2. **Vote Changes**
- ✅ Users can change their vote at any time before votes are revealed
- ✅ The system uses `upsert` functionality to update existing votes
- ✅ Real-time events differentiate between new votes and changed votes
- ✅ Loading indicators show when votes are being saved

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- ✅ When a team member submits/changes a vote, all other participants see it instantly
- ✅ Uses Supabase real-time channels for instant synchronization
- ✅ Moderator sees team votes update in real-time in the "Team Votes" section
- ✅ Visual notifications appear when votes are submitted/changed
- ✅ Vote count updates automatically

### 4. **Team Votes Display**
- ✅ "Team Votes" section shows all participant votes for the current backlog item
- ✅ Shows voter name, role, and timestamp
- ✅ Votes are hidden (shown as "?") until moderator reveals them
- ✅ Visual indicators show which vote belongs to the current user
- ✅ Loading states during vote updates
- ✅ Empty state when no votes are submitted yet

### 5. **User Experience Enhancements**
- ✅ User's current vote is clearly displayed with ability to change
- ✅ Visual feedback when voting cards are selected
- ✅ Loading indicators during vote submission
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Instructions for users who haven't voted yet

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
estimations table:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- session_id (UUID, foreign key to planning_sessions)
- backlog_item_id (UUID, foreign key to backlog_items)
- user_id (TEXT, matches Supabase auth.uid())
- value (TEXT, supports both numbers and T-shirt sizes)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
- Unique constraint: (session_id, backlog_item_id, user_id)
```

### Real-time Events
- `vote-submitted`: Broadcasted when a user votes for the first time
- `vote-changed`: Broadcasted when a user changes their existing vote
- Events include: itemId, voterId, voterName, value, timestamp

### Vote Flow
1. User selects estimate from voting cards
2. Vote is saved to database via `submitEstimation()`
3. Real-time event is broadcast to all session participants
4. Other participants see vote count update and notification
5. Moderator can reveal votes to show all estimates
6. Users can change votes until revelation

## Testing Instructions

### Multi-User Testing
1. **Setup Multiple Users**:
   - Open multiple browser windows/tabs or use different browsers
   - Sign up as different users with different roles (Moderator vs Team Member)
   - Join the same planning session

2. **Test Voting Flow**:
   - Have Team Members vote on backlog items
   - Verify votes appear in real-time for all participants
   - Test changing votes and confirm updates are reflected instantly
   - Verify vote counts update correctly

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Rapid vote changes
   - Network disconnection/reconnection
   - Page refresh during voting
   - Multiple items in the same session

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Team member votes → immediately visible to moderator and other team members
- ✅ Vote changes → instant updates for all participants
- ✅ Votes persist → survive page refreshes and session rejoins
- ✅ Real-time sync → no manual refresh needed to see updates
- ✅ Error handling → graceful failure with user feedback
