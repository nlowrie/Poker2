# Video Conferencing UI Cleanup - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Redundant Status Indicators**
- **Problem**: There were duplicate "Video Call Active" status indicators appearing in both the main session controls and the video interface navigation bar.
- **Solution**: Removed the redundant status indicator from the main session controls area, keeping only the one in the video interface navigation bar.

### 2. **Redundant Video Controls**
- **Problem**: The main "Start/End Video Call" button was still showing when the video interface was active, creating confusion with the video navigation bar controls.
- **Solution**: 
  - Hide the main "Start Video Call" button when the video interface is active
  - Show only "Start Video Call" button when video is not active
  - Users can end the call using the red phone button in the video interface navigation bar

### 3. **Improved Video Call Flow**
- **Problem**: The video call end functionality wasn't properly synchronized between the main controls and video interface.
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a dedicated `endVideoCall()` function that properly ends the call and broadcasts to all participants
  - The video interface "End Call" button now properly triggers the end call functionality
  - Removed the toggle behavior from the video interface end button

## Current User Experience Flow

### Starting a Video Call
1. User clicks the green "Start Video Call" button in the session controls
2. Browser prompts for camera/microphone permissions
3. Video interface appears with navigation bar and participant circles
4. The main "Start Video Call" button disappears (no longer needed)
5. Other participants see the video interface appear automatically

### During Video Call
- Video interface shows:
  - Navigation bar with status, participant count, and controls
  - Circular video displays for all participants
  - Mute, camera, settings, and end call buttons
- Main session controls show:
  - Chat toggle button
  - Estimation type selector (for moderators)
  - **No video button** (since video interface is active)

### Ending a Video Call
1. User clicks the red "End Call" button in the video interface navigation bar
2. Video interface disappears
3. Main "Start Video Call" button reappears
4. All participants see the video interface disappear automatically

## Technical Improvements

### Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages for camera/microphone permission issues
- Added fallback options for users who deny permissions
- Clear user feedback for different types of errors

### Permission Handling
- Better detection of permission denial
- Offer to join with audio-only or without media if camera is denied
- Graceful fallback for users without cameras/microphones

### Role-Based Display
- Both moderators and team members can start video calls
- User roles are properly displayed in the video interface
- Anonymous users are clearly identified with consistent naming

## User Benefits
