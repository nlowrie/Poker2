# Real-Time Timer Synchronization Testing Guide

## üéØ New Feature: Synchronized Voting Timer

The voting timer is now synchronized across all session participants in real-time. When a moderator starts, pauses, or resets the timer, all team members will see the changes instantly.

## ‚ú® Features Added:

- **Moderators:** Full timer controls (start, pause, reset)
- **Team Members:** Timer display with status indicators
- **Active Timer:** Pulsing red clock icon and animated progress bar
- **Timer Banner:** Prominent notification for team members when timer is active

### 3. **Audio Notifications**
- Sound notification when timer starts (for team members)
- Warning beeps at 30, 10, and 5 seconds remaining
- Final notification when timer reaches zero

### 4. **Enhanced UI**
- Progress bar showing time remaining
- Color changes (blue ‚Üí red) as time runs low
- Clear status messages for different timer states (Active, Paused, Waiting)
- Separate notification banners for active vs paused states

## üß™ How to Test:

### Setup (Use Multiple Browsers):
1. **Browser 1 (Moderator):**
   - Sign in as moderator
   - Create and start a planning session
   - Navigate to an item with voting

2. **Browser 2 (Team Member):**
   - Use invite link or join session
   - Sign in as team member
   - Navigate to the same voting item

### Test Scenarios:

#### ‚úÖ **Timer Start Sync**
1. Moderator clicks "Start Timer"
2. **Expected:** Team member immediately sees:
   - Timer countdown begins
   - Red pulsing clock icon
   - Orange notification banner
   - Audio beep notification

#### ‚úÖ **Timer Pause/Resume Sync**
1. While timer is active, moderator clicks "Pause"
2. **Expected:** Team member sees:
   - Timer stops counting down
   - Yellow "Timer Paused" banner appears
   - Clock icon stops pulsing
   - Status shows "‚è∏Ô∏è Timer Paused"

3. Moderator clicks "Resume"
4. **Expected:** Team member sees:
   - Timer resumes countdown from where it left off
   - Red "Timer Active" banner returns
   - Clock icon starts pulsing again
   - Status shows "‚è∞ Timer Active - Vote Now!"

#### ‚úÖ **Timer Reset Sync**
1. Moderator clicks "Reset" 
2. **Expected:** Team member sees:
   - Timer returns to full duration
   - Ready state displayed

#### ‚úÖ **Audio Notifications**
1. Let timer count down to 30, 10, 5 seconds
2. **Expected:** Team member hears beeps at each threshold
3. When timer reaches 0, final beep plays

#### ‚úÖ **Visual Progress**
1. Watch progress bar during countdown
2. **Expected:** 
   - Bar gradually decreases
   - Color changes from blue to red under 60 seconds
   - Smooth animations

## üîß Technical Implementation:

- **Supabase Realtime:** Using broadcast channels for timer synchronization
- **Channel Name:** `timer-${sessionId}` for session-specific communication
- **Events:** `timer-start`, `timer-pause`, `timer-resume`, `timer-reset`, `timer-tick`
- **Audio:** Web Audio API for cross-browser sound notifications

## üêõ Troubleshooting:

**Timer not syncing?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection
- Try refreshing both browsers

**No audio notifications?**
- Browser may block audio autoplay
- User interaction required first (click somewhere on page)

**Timer seems delayed?**
- Network latency may cause small delays (normal)
- Usually < 1 second difference between clients

## üéØ Success Criteria:

‚úÖ Moderator starts timer ‚Üí Team member sees countdown immediately  
‚úÖ Timer pause/resume works across browsers  
‚úÖ Timer reset works across browsers  
‚úÖ Audio notifications play for team members  
‚úÖ Visual indicators clearly show timer status (Active/Paused/Waiting)  
‚úÖ Progress bar and colors update correctly  
‚úÖ All timer events synchronized in real-time

The synchronized timer creates a much more engaging and coordinated voting experience for all session participants!
