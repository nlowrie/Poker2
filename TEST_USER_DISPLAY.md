# Testing Guide: User Display in Team Votes

## Overview
This document provides a structured approach to test the fixed user display functionality in the Team Votes section of the VotingSession component.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure the development server is running
- Have at least two browser windows open (different users)
- Make sure you're logged in with authenticated users

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Authentication Display Test
- **Objective:** Verify that an authenticated user's name appears correctly in the team votes section
- **Steps:**
  1. Log in as a known user
  2. Join a voting session
  3. Vote on an item
  4. Check that your name appears correctly in the team votes section
  5. Verify that your name matches what's shown in the session header

### 2. Multiple Users Test
- **Objective:** Verify that multiple users' names appear correctly
- **Steps:**
  1. Have two different authenticated users join the same session
  2. Have both users vote on the same item
  3. Verify both names appear correctly in the team votes section

### 3. Edge Case: Reconnection Test
- **Objective:** Ensure user display remains consistent after reconnection
- **Steps:**
  1. Vote on an item
  2. Refresh the page
  3. Verify your vote and name are still displayed correctly

### 4. Debug Logging Check
- **Objective:** Review the console logs to verify user information is being processed correctly
- **Steps:**
  1. Open browser developer tools
  2. Look for "Session items structure" log
  3. Look for "Presence state" log
  4. Verify that the logged data contains the expected user information

## Expected Results
- Authenticated usernames should always be displayed instead of fallback names like "User efaf"
- User avatars should match those shown elsewhere in the application
- The console logs should show proper user data structures

## Using the Verification Script

To help with testing, we've created a verification script that checks for proper user display:

1. Open your browser's developer console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Run this command to load the verification script:
   ```javascript
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = '/verify-user-display.js';
   document.body.appendChild(script);
   ```
3. The script will automatically check for authenticated user info and team votes display
4. If you want to run the check again later (after more votes), type:
   ```javascript
   window.verifyUserDisplay();
   ```
5. Check the console logs for any warnings about "fallback names"

## Reporting Issues
If any issues are found during testing, please document:
1. The specific test case that failed
2. What was expected vs. what actually happened
3. Any relevant console logs or errors
4. Screenshots if applicable
