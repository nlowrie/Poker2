# Fix: Reset Current Item Button Broadcasting

## Issue Identified
When a moderator clicks the "Reset Current Item" button in the moderator panel, it resets the voting state in the moderator's view but does not reset the view for other participants. Other users continue to see the old votes and reveal state.

## Root Cause
The "Reset Current Item" button was only performing local state changes without broadcasting the reset action to other session participants:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Local only)
onClick={() => {
  setMyVote(null);
  setVotes([]);
  setIsRevealed(false);
  // No broadcasting to other participants
}}
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Reset Button with Broadcasting
Modified the "Reset Current Item" button to broadcast the reset action:

```typescript
// AFTER (Broadcast to all participants)
onClick={() => {
  console.log('🔄 RESET CURRENT ITEM BUTTON CLICKED');
  console.log('📊 Current state before reset:', { myVote, votes: votes.length, isRevealed });
  
  // Reset local state
  setMyVote(null);
  setVotes([]);
  setIsRevealed(false);
  console.log('✅ Current item reset - votes cleared, reveal hidden');
  
  // Broadcast reset to all participants
  if (channel && currentUser.role === 'Moderator') {
    console.log('📡 Broadcasting current item reset to all participants');
    channel.send({
      type: 'broadcast',
      event: 'item-reset',
      payload: {
        resetBy: user?.id,
        itemId: currentItem?.id
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Broadcast Receiver
Added a new broadcast event listener to handle 'item-reset' events:

```typescript
.on('broadcast', { event: 'item-reset' }, (payload) => {
  console.log('📡 Received item reset broadcast from:', payload.payload.resetBy);
  if (payload.payload.resetBy !== user?.id) {
    console.log('🔄 Applying item reset from moderator');
    setMyVote(null);
    setVotes([]);
    setIsRevealed(false);
    console.log('✅ Item reset applied - votes cleared, reveal hidden');
  } else {
    console.log('🔄 Ignoring own item reset broadcast');
  }
})
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- When the reset button is clicked
- Current state before reset
- Broadcasting status
- Received broadcast events
- Applied state changes

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
Moderator clicks "Reset Current Item":
- Moderator view: ✅ Votes cleared, reveal hidden
- Participant view: ❌ Still shows old votes and reveal state
```

### After Fix:
```
Moderator clicks "Reset Current Item":
- Moderator view: ✅ Votes cleared, reveal hidden
- Participant view: ✅ Votes cleared, reveal hidden (synchronized)
```

## Button Locations

### 1. Timer Reset Button
- **Location:** Timer controls section
- **Functionality:** Resets timer to configured duration
- **Broadcasting:** ✅ Already working (broadcasts 'timer-reset')

### 2. Reset Current Item Button
- **Location:** Moderator voting controls section  
- **Functionality:** Clears all votes and hides reveal for current item
- **Broadcasting:** ✅ Fixed (now broadcasts 'item-reset')

## Console Output to Expect

### When Moderator Clicks Reset:
```
🔄 RESET CURRENT ITEM BUTTON CLICKED
📊 Current state before reset: { myVote: "5", votes: 3, isRevealed: true }
✅ Current item reset - votes cleared, reveal hidden
📡 Broadcasting current item reset to all participants
```

### When Participants Receive Reset:
```
📡 Received item reset broadcast from: moderator_user_id
🔄 Applying item reset from moderator
✅ Item reset applied - votes cleared, reveal hidden
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Basic Reset Synchronization
1. **Multiple users join session and vote on current item**
2. **Moderator reveals votes** (all users see revealed votes)
3. **Moderator clicks "Reset Current Item"**
4. **Expected:** All participants should see votes cleared and reveal hidden

### Test Case 2: Reset During Active Voting
1. **Some users vote, others haven't yet**
2. **Moderator clicks "Reset Current Item"**  
3. **Expected:** All participants see cleared state, can vote again

### Test Case 3: Reset After Timer Expiry
1. **Timer expires and votes are auto-revealed**
2. **Moderator clicks "Reset Current Item"**
3. **Expected:** All participants see reset state, timer remains as is

### Test Case 4: Console Logging Verification
1. **Open browser console for both moderator and participant**
2. **Perform reset action**
3. **Expected:** Both should show appropriate log messages

## Security Considerations

### Moderator-Only Broadcasting
- Only users with `currentUser.role === 'Moderator'` can broadcast resets
- Non-moderators cannot trigger reset broadcasts
- All participants can receive and apply resets

### Broadcast Filtering
- Users ignore their own reset broadcasts to prevent double-application
- Each user processes resets from other users only

## Technical Details

### Event Structure
```typescript
{
  type: 'broadcast',
  event: 'item-reset',
  payload: {
    resetBy: string,    // User ID of moderator who triggered reset
    itemId: string      // Current backlog item ID
  }
}
```

### State Changes Applied
- `setMyVote(null)` - Clears user's current vote
- `setVotes([])` - Clears all visible votes
- `setIsRevealed(false)` - Hides vote reveal state

## Files Modified
- `src/components/VotingSession.tsx` - Enhanced reset button with broadcasting and added broadcast receiver

## Expected Impact
- ✅ **Synchronization:** All participants see reset state simultaneously
- ✅ **User Experience:** Consistent voting interface across all users
- ✅ **Moderator Control:** Moderators can effectively reset voting rounds
- ✅ **Debugging:** Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
