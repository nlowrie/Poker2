# Planning Dashboard Consensus Estimate Display Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Planning Dashboard to display consensus estimate status for assigned backlog items in session cards and preview modals. The dashboard now clearly shows which items have been estimated with consensus values and which items only have votes but no consensus yet.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Session Data Loading (`src/components/PlanningDashboard.tsx`)

#### New State Management
- Added `sessionConsensusEstimates` state to track consensus estimates per session
- Enhanced `loadSessionsWithItems()` to fetch consensus estimates alongside estimation status

#### Consensus Data Integration
```typescript
// Fetch consensus estimates for each session
const consensusEstimates = await getSessionConsensusEstimates(session.id);
const consensusMap: {[itemId: string]: any} = {};
consensusEstimates.forEach((estimate: any) => {
  consensusMap[estimate.backlog_item_id] = estimate;
});
consensusEstimatesData[session.id] = consensusMap;
```

### 2. Enhanced Visual Indicators

#### Updated Status Icons (`getEstimationStatusIcon`)
- **Blue Checkmark** (ðŸ”µ): Item has consensus estimate applied
- **Green Checkmark** (ðŸŸ¢): Item has votes but no consensus yet  
- **Gray Circle** (âšª): No votes yet

#### Icon Logic:
1. **Consensus Applied**: Blue checkmark with tooltip showing consensus value
2. **Votes Only**: Green checkmark with vote count tooltip
3. **No Votes**: Gray circle with "No votes yet" tooltip

### 3. Enhanced Session Cards Display

#### "Estimated" Badges
Items with consensus estimates now show:
```jsx
<span className="bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 px-2 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium">
  Estimated: 5 SP
</span>
```

#### Vote Count Badges
Items with votes but no consensus show:
```jsx
<span className="bg-green-100 text-green-800 px-2 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium">
  3 votes
</span>
```

### 4. Enhanced Session Preview Modal

#### Consensus Details Section
Items with consensus estimates display:
```jsx
<div className="mt-2 pt-2 border-t border-gray-200 bg-blue-50 p-2 rounded">
  <p className="text-xs font-medium text-blue-800">
    âœ… Consensus Applied: 5 SP
  </p>
  <p className="text-xs text-blue-600">
    Applied 12/17/2025
  </p>
</div>
```

#### Vote Details for Non-Consensus Items
Items with votes but no consensus show:
```jsx
<div className="mt-2 pt-2 border-t border-gray-200">
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
    Votes: 3, 5, 8
  </p>
</div>
```

## Visual Hierarchy

### Session Card View
```
ðŸ“‹ User Story 1 - High ðŸ”µ [Estimated: 5 SP]
ðŸ“‹ User Story 2 - Medium ðŸŸ¢ [3 votes]
ðŸ“‹ User Story 3 - Low âšª
```

### Session Preview Modal
```
User Story 1 - High ðŸ”µ [Estimated: 5 SP]
Description: As a user, I want...
âœ… Consensus Applied: 5 SP
Applied 12/17/2025

User Story 2 - Medium ðŸŸ¢ [3 votes]
Description: As a user, I want...
Votes: 3, 5, 8
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Enhancement:
- No distinction between voted and consensus-applied items
- Unclear which items need moderator attention
- No visibility into consensus values from dashboard

### After Enhancement:
- âœ… **Clear Visual Distinction**: Blue = Estimated, Green = Voted, Gray = Unvoted
- âœ… **Consensus Values Visible**: See exact consensus estimates in dashboard
- âœ… **Vote Count Display**: See participation level for non-consensus items
- âœ… **Timeline Information**: See when consensus was applied
- âœ… **Prioritization Aid**: Easily identify items needing attention

## Icon Legend

| Icon | Color | Status | Meaning |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| âœ… | Blue | Estimated | Consensus estimate applied |
| âœ… | Green | Voted | Has votes, no consensus yet |
| âšª | Gray | Unvoted | No votes submitted |

## Badge System

### Consensus Estimate Badge
- **Color**: Blue background
- **Text**: "Estimated: [value] [unit]"
- **Example**: "Estimated: 5 SP" or "Estimated: M"

### Vote Count Badge  
- **Color**: Green background
- **Text**: "[count] vote(s)"
- **Example**: "3 votes" or "1 vote"

## Database Integration

### Required Data:
- **Consensus Estimates**: From `consensus_estimates` table
- **Estimation Status**: From `estimations` table aggregated data
- **Session Items**: From `session_items` with backlog item details

### Performance Optimization:
- Bulk fetch consensus estimates per session
- Cached in component state for fast rendering
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Mixed Estimation States
1. Create session with multiple items
2. Apply consensus to some items
3. Have votes on other items (no consensus)
4. Leave some items unvoted
5. **Expected**: Dashboard shows different icons and badges correctly

### Test 2: Consensus Value Display
1. Apply Fibonacci consensus (e.g., "5")
2. Apply T-shirt consensus (e.g., "M")
3. **Expected**: "Estimated: 5 SP" and "Estimated: M" display correctly

### Test 3: Session Preview Details
1. Click "Preview" on session with mixed estimation states
2. **Expected**: 
   - Consensus items show blue badges and consensus details
   - Voted items show green badges and vote details
   - Unvoted items show no additional details

### Test 4: Tooltip Information
1. Hover over status icons
2. **Expected**: Appropriate tooltips display for each status type

## Benefits

### For Product Managers:
- **Quick Assessment**: Instantly see estimation progress across sessions
- **Prioritization**: Identify items needing moderator attention
- **Planning**: See consensus values for planning purposes

### For Moderators:
- **Session Management**: Clear view of which items need consensus
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor team estimation completion
- **Decision Making**: See vote distributions and consensus history

### For Team Members:
- **Transparency**: Understand which items have been finalized
- **Context**: See consensus values and application dates
- **Progress**: Track team estimation progress

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Consensus Quality Indicators**: Show vote variance/agreement level
- **Bulk Consensus Operations**: Apply consensus to multiple items
- **Estimation History**: Show consensus changes over time
- **Export Capabilities**: Export session estimation summaries
- **Notification System**: Alert when consensus is applied

### Integration Opportunities:
- **Backlog Item Updates**: Sync consensus to story points field
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Estimation accuracy tracking
- **Reporting**: Generate estimation completion reports
- **API Endpoints**: Expose consensus data via REST API

The Planning Dashboard now provides comprehensive visibility into estimation progress with clear visual indicators that help teams understand the status of their planning poker sessions at a glance.
