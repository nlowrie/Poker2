# Timer Functionality Test Guide

## Expected Timer Behavior

### 1. Start Timer
**Action**: Click "Start Timer" button
**Expected Result**: 
- Timer starts countdown from configured interval (default: 5 minutes = 300 seconds)
- Timer displays counting down: 4:59, 4:58, 4:57...
- Console log: `▶️ Starting timer with configured duration: 300 seconds`

### 2. Pause Timer
**Action**: Click "Pause" button while timer is running
**Expected Result**:
- Timer stops counting down immediately
- Time remaining is preserved (e.g., if paused at 4:23, it stays at 4:23)
- Console log: `⏸️ Pause timer clicked` and `⏸️ Timer set to inactive`

### 3. Resume Timer
**Action**: Click "Resume" button while timer is paused
**Expected Result**:
- Timer continues counting down from where it was paused
- If paused at 4:23, it resumes from 4:23 and continues: 4:22, 4:21, 4:20...
- Console log: `▶️ Resume timer clicked` and `▶️ Timer set to active`

### 4. Reset Timer
**Action**: Click "Reset Timer" button (available any time)
**Expected Result**:
- Timer stops counting (if it was running)
- Timer resets to full configured interval (e.g., back to 5:00)
- Timer is in stopped state (not counting)
- Console log: `🔄 resetTimer function called` and `🔄 Setting timer to configured duration: 300 seconds`

## Complete Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Start → Pause → Resume → Reset
1. Click "Start Timer" → Timer starts at 5:00 and counts down
2. Wait for timer to reach ~4:30, then click "Pause" → Timer stops at 4:30
3. Click "Resume" → Timer continues from 4:30 (4:29, 4:28...)
4. Click "Reset Timer" → Timer resets to 5:00 and stops

### Scenario B: Start → Reset → Start Again
1. Click "Start Timer" → Timer starts at 5:00 and counts down
2. Wait for timer to reach ~3:45, then click "Reset Timer" → Timer resets to 5:00 and stops
3. Click "Start Timer" → Timer starts fresh countdown from 5:00

### Scenario C: Change Timer Interval → Reset
1. Change timer setting from 5 minutes to 3 minutes
2. Click "Reset Timer" → Timer should reset to 3:00 (not 5:00)
3. Click "Start Timer" → Timer starts from 3:00

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Start Timer**: Always uses configured interval, never preserves old countdown
2. **Fixed Timer Logic**: Changed from `setTimeout` to `setInterval` for more reliable timing
3. **Consolidated Reset**: Both reset button and reset function use same logic
4. **Improved Logging**: Added detailed console logs for debugging

## Console Log Patterns to Look For

**Successful Start**: 
```
▶️ Starting timer with configured duration: 300 seconds
⏰ Timer effect triggered: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 300}
⏰ Setting up timer interval - time remaining: 300
⏰ Timer tick - new time: 299
```

**Successful Pause**:
```
⏸️ Pause timer clicked - current state: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 250}
⏸️ Timer set to inactive
⏰ Clearing timer interval
```

**Successful Resume**:
```
▶️ Resume timer clicked - current state: {timerActive: false, timeRemaining: 250}
▶️ Timer set to active
⏰ Timer effect triggered: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 250}
⏰ Setting up timer interval - time remaining: 250
```

**Successful Reset**:
```
🔄 resetTimer function called - current state: {timerActive: true, timeRemaining: 180}
🔄 Setting timer to configured duration: 300 seconds
🔄 Broadcasting timer reset to all clients
```

## Testing Notes

- No time should be lost between pause/resume cycles
- Reset should always return to configured interval
- Timer should not restart automatically after reset
- All participants should see synchronized timer state
