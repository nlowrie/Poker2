# Fix: Cross-User Display in Team Votes (nicholas.d.lowrie in testmod view)

## Issue Identified
When **testmod** views the team votes, **nicholas.d.lowrie@gmail.com**'s vote appears as "Anonymous User" instead of showing their proper name and avatar like it does in nicholas.d.lowrie's own session view.

## Root Cause
The user name resolution logic only had special handling for the **current user** (the person logged in), but not for **other users** in the session. When database queries don't return user profile information for other participants, the system would fall back to "Anonymous User".

## Solution Applied

### 1. Leveraging Participants Data
The application already tracks session participants through real-time presence:
```typescript
participants = [{
  id: "user_id_123",
  name: "nicholas.d.lowrie", // Extracted from email
  role: "Moderator",
  isOnline: true,
  lastSeen: Date
}]
```

### 2. Enhanced User Name Resolution
Added a new step in the name resolution process:
```typescript
// If still no name, try to find the user in the participants list
if (!userName) {
  const participant = participants.find(p => p.id === est.user_id);
  if (participant) {
    userName = participant.name;
    console.log('üîç Found user in participants:', { user_id: est.user_id, name: participant.name });
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated Resolution Priority
The new user name resolution order is:

**For All Users (including others):**
1. `est.user_profiles?.full_name` - Database user profile
2. `est.user_metadata?.full_name` - Auth metadata  
3. `est.users?.email?.split('@')[0]` - Users table email
4. `est.email?.split('@')[0]` - Direct email field
5. **NEW:** `participants.find(p => p.id === est.user_id)?.name` - From presence tracking
6. Special current user handling (if applicable)
7. `'Anonymous User'` - Final fallback

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
testmod session view:
[ND] nicholas.d.lowrie (Moderator) - You  ‚úÖ (worked)
[AU] Anonymous User (Team Member)        ‚ùå (broken - should be testmod)

nicholas.d.lowrie session view:  
[ND] nicholas.d.lowrie (Moderator) - You  ‚úÖ (worked)
[AU] Anonymous User (Team Member)        ‚ùå (broken - should be testmod)
```

### After Fix:
```
testmod session view:
[TM] testmod (Team Member) - You         ‚úÖ (fixed)
[ND] nicholas.d.lowrie (Moderator)       ‚úÖ (fixed)

nicholas.d.lowrie session view:
[ND] nicholas.d.lowrie (Moderator) - You ‚úÖ (still works)
[TM] testmod (Team Member)               ‚úÖ (fixed)
```

## Debug Information Enhanced

### Console Output to Expect:
```javascript
üîç Debug - Current participants: [
  { id: "user_123", name: "nicholas.d.lowrie", role: "Moderator" },
  { id: "user_456", name: "testmod", role: "Team Member" }
]

üîç Found user in participants: { 
  user_id: "user_123", 
  name: "nicholas.d.lowrie" 
}

üîç Final resolved user name: {
  user_id: "user_123",
  finalUserName: "nicholas.d.lowrie",
  isCurrentUser: false,
  participantFound: "nicholas.d.lowrie",
  participantsCount: 2,
  estimationSources: {
    user_profiles_full_name: null,
    user_metadata_full_name: null,
    users_email: null,
    direct_email: null,
    // ... other sources
  }
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: testmod viewing nicholas.d.lowrie's vote
1. Log in as **testmod**
2. Join session where **nicholas.d.lowrie@gmail.com** has voted
3. Check team votes table
4. **Expected:** `[ND] nicholas.d.lowrie (Moderator)`
5. **Check console:** Should show "Found user in participants" message

### Test Scenario 2: nicholas.d.lowrie viewing testmod's vote  
1. Log in as **nicholas.d.lowrie@gmail.com**
2. Join session where **testmod** has voted
3. Check team votes table
4. **Expected:** `[TM] testmod (Team Member)`
5. **Check console:** Should show "Found user in participants" message

### Test Scenario 3: Both users in same session
1. Both users vote on same item
2. Each user should see the other's name correctly
3. No "Anonymous User" should appear for active session participants

## Key Technical Details

### Presence Tracking Integration
The fix leverages the existing real-time presence system that already extracts proper usernames:
```typescript
user_name: user.user_metadata?.full_name || user.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User'
```

### Cross-User Name Resolution
Now when **any user** votes, **all other users** in the session can see their proper name because it's stored in the shared participants state.

### Backward Compatibility
The fix maintains all existing name resolution fallbacks, only adding a new step that uses available session participant data.

## Files Modified
- `src/components/VotingSession.tsx` - Enhanced user name resolution with participants lookup

## Expected Impact
- ‚úÖ **nicholas.d.lowrie** shows correctly in **testmod's** view
- ‚úÖ **testmod** shows correctly in **nicholas.d.lowrie's** view  
- ‚úÖ All session participants display proper names and avatars
- ‚úÖ No more "Anonymous User" for active session participants
- ‚úÖ Maintains special handling for current user identification
