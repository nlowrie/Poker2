## Consolidation Summary

These files were moved here on June 21, 2025 as part of a codebase cleanup to:
1. Remove duplicate code
2. Clarify which component is actively used
3. Maintain backup versions for reference if needed
4. Clean up the main components directory

If these archived versions are no longer needed for reference, they can be safely deleted.
