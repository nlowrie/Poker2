# Team Votes Display Improvement

## Issue Fixed
The team votes table was displaying participant names as "User 5196" (using the last 4 characters of user ID) instead of showing actual user names with proper avatars.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved User Name Resolution
**Before:**
```typescript
const userName = est.user_profiles?.full_name || 
                est.user_metadata?.full_name || 
                `User ${est.user_id.slice(-4)}`; // This showed "User 5196"
```

**After:**
```typescript
const userName = est.user_profiles?.full_name || 
                est.user_metadata?.full_name || 
                est.users?.email?.split('@')[0] ||
                est.email?.split('@')[0] ||
                'Anonymous User';
```

### 2. Enhanced User Avatar Display
**Before:**
- Small 32px (w-8 h-8) avatar with single initial
- Plain blue background
- Only first letter of name

**After:**
- Larger 40px (w-10 h-10) avatar
- Gradient background (blue to purple)
- Shows up to 2 initials for better identification
- Proper initials generation for multi-word names

### 3. Better Fallback Strategy
The new user name resolution tries multiple sources in order:
1. `user_profiles.full_name` - Full name from user profile
2. `user_metadata.full_name` - Full name from auth metadata  
3. `users.email` - Email from users table (takes part before @)
4. `email` - Direct email field (takes part before @)
5. `'Anonymous User'` - Clean fallback instead of cryptic user ID

### 4. Improved Avatar Generation
```typescript
const getInitials = (name: string) => {
  return name
    .split(' ')
    .map(word => word.charAt(0))
    .join('')
    .toUpperCase()
    .slice(0, 2);
};
```

**Examples:**
- "John Doe" → "JD"
- "Alice Smith Johnson" → "AS"  
- "Bob" → "B"
- "anonymous user" → "AN"

## Visual Improvements

### Team Votes Display
- **Larger, more prominent user avatars**
- **Gradient backgrounds** for better visual appeal
- **Proper initials** instead of single letters
- **Clean user names** instead of user ID codes
- **Consistent styling** with the rest of the application

### User Experience Benefits
1. **Better identification** - Real names instead of cryptic codes
2. **Visual consistency** - Proper avatars throughout the app
3. **Professional appearance** - No technical user IDs visible to users
4. **Improved accessibility** - Meaningful names for screen readers

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Users with Full Names
- Users with complete profile names should show their full names
- Avatars should show proper initials (e.g., "John Doe" → "JD")

### Test Case 2: Users with Email Only
- Users without profile names should show email username part
- e.g., "john.doe@company.com" → "john.doe" with "JD" initials

### Test Case 3: Mixed User Types
- Some users with full names, others with email-only
- All should display consistently with proper avatars
- No "User 5196" style codes should appear

### Test Case 4: Edge Cases
- Very long names should be truncated gracefully
- Single word names should show single initial
- Empty/null names should fall back to "Anonymous User"

## Files Modified
- `src/components/VotingSession.tsx` - Enhanced user name resolution and avatar display

## Expected Results
✅ **Before:** "User 5196" with small single-letter avatar  
✅ **After:** "John Doe" with gradient "JD" avatar

The team votes table now provides a professional, user-friendly display of participant names and avatars that matches the quality of the rest of the application.
